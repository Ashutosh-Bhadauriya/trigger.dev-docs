title: Introduction

The integration of OpenAI and Trigger.dev provides a seamless solution for handling long-running tasks in a serverless context. By leveraging background tasks, you can run extensive OpenAI completions without worrying about serverless function time restrictions.

## Installation

Choose your preferred package manager and install the `@trigger.dev/openai` package.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

OpenAI supports API Key based authentication. You can sign up for OpenAI and get your API key which will be used to authenticate your requests to OpenAI API.

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "@trigger.dev/openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  id: "openai",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
```

## Example Jobs

Let's take a look at job below, it demonstrates how to utilize background tasks to handle long-running OpenAI completions on a serverless architecture, offloading the workload to Trigger.dev.

The "OpenAI Tasks" job uses the backgroundCreateChatCompletion task to generate a response based on a provided message. The generation might take time depending on the complexity of the message, making it a good candidate for a background task.

```ts
new Job(client, {
  id: "openai-tasks",
  name: "OpenAI Tasks",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.tasks",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateChatCompletion(
      "background-chat-completion",
      {
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            content: "Create a good programming joke about background jobs",
          },
        ],
      }
    );

    await io.logger.info("choices", response.choices);
  },
});
```

## Tasks

Tasks that are marked as "long-running" can last longer than your serverless timeout – they are performed on one of our background workers.

| Function Name                    | Description                                                               | Long-running? |
